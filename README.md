# isaperson

## is your code alive?

Worried that the script you just finished writing might be a person?

Compatible with most versions of TensorFlow, Flax, and PyTorch, `isaperson` efficiently checks whether your large language model — or any Python application or script! — is a person.

A large language model may be just the ticket if you are building a search engine or auto-assistant or doing other worthwhile things like helping mental health counselors practice realistic-feeling conversations about a mental health crisis.

People can also use a large language model to generate realistic-feeling social media posts, to inflame other people’s passions and undermine a democracy, or to generate realistic-sounding emails, to scam many people at once. If you are a reporter who has a chance to interact with a large language model, please tell that story! The story isn’t that the model you are interacting with might be a person. The story is that we people need to work on protecting our fellow people from mistakenly thinking a piece of software is people.

## other living things

Speaking of sentient creatures, please check in on whether the humans around you are earning a living wage, can get the medical and mental health care they deserve, are able to spend time with the people they care about, and have enough time left over in the week to enjoy being alive, follow their curiosity, and pursue their dreams.

Please consider supporting fellow people who are living in extreme poverty. While the Python Virtual Machine has no coin slot for supporting your favorite script, GiveDirectly helps you give cash to very poor families, mostly in Africa, and also now in Chicago, to spend as they like. The majority of people in the world live on less than $3,700 per year, and you can help lessen that extreme inequality today: https://www.every.org/givedirectly/f/isapersonpy-users-are.


And please consider supporting Jonathan, a wonderful human living in Brooklyn who delivers food when his disability allows him to. A very close friend of a friend, Jonathan has been going through a hard time while waiting for medical care to treat his severe Crohn’s: https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-a-friend-struggling-with-crohns-disease.
